# How to Make GitHub Auto-Commits Count as Contributions

## The Problem
GitHub Actions commits using `GITHUB_TOKEN` don't count towards your contribution graph, even with the correct email configured.

## The Solution: Use a Personal Access Token (PAT)

Follow these steps to make your auto-commits appear in your contribution graph:

### Step 1: Create a Personal Access Token

1. Go to GitHub Settings: https://github.com/settings/tokens
2. Click **"Generate new token"** → **"Generate new token (classic)"**
3. Give it a name like: `Auto Commit Token`
4. Set expiration: Choose "No expiration" or a long period
5. Select scopes:
   - ✅ `repo` (Full control of private repositories)
   - ✅ `workflow` (Update GitHub Action workflows)
6. Click **"Generate token"**
7. **IMPORTANT**: Copy the token immediately (you won't see it again!)

### Step 2: Add Token as Repository Secret

1. Go to your repository: https://github.com/Lethinkj/Loophole
2. Click **Settings** → **Secrets and variables** → **Actions**
3. Click **"New repository secret"**
4. Name: `PAT_TOKEN`
5. Value: Paste the token you copied
6. Click **"Add secret"**

### Step 3: Tell Me When Done

Once you've added the PAT_TOKEN secret, let me know and I'll update the workflows to use it. Then your commits will show up in your contribution graph!

## Why This Works

- `GITHUB_TOKEN` is a temporary token that GitHub doesn't associate with your account
- A Personal Access Token (PAT) is directly linked to your account
- Commits made with a PAT count as personal contributions
- Your contribution graph will show all the auto-commits with your PAT

## Current Status

✅ Workflows are running (every 1 hour and 3.5 hours)
✅ Correct email configured: kjlethin24@gmail.com
❌ Using GITHUB_TOKEN (doesn't count as contributions)
⏳ Waiting for PAT_TOKEN to be added
