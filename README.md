# Loophole - Auto Commit Repository

This repository automatically commits changes every 5 minutes using GitHub Actions - no manual intervention required!

## 🤖 How it Works

- **Fully Automated**: Runs in GitHub's cloud using GitHub Actions
- **5-minute intervals**: Attempts to commit every 5 minutes (subject to GitHub's scheduling)
- **Alternating Pattern**: 
  - ➕ **Add Cycle**: Adds 5 lines to the `loop` file
  - ➖ **Remove Cycle**: Removes 4 lines from the `loop` file
- **Zero Maintenance**: No need to run anything on your PC!

## 📊 Current Status

The repository grows by approximately 1 line every 10 minutes (5 added, then 4 removed).

## 🔧 Workflows

1. **`auto-commit.yml`** - Basic 5-minute schedule
2. **`high-frequency-auto-commit.yml`** - Enhanced version with better timing control

## 📁 Files

- `loop` - Target file that gets modified
- `commit-state.json` - Tracks whether to add or remove lines next
- `last-auto-commit.txt` - Timestamp of last commit
- Auto-commit scripts (for local testing if needed)
