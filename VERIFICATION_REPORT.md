### 📈 Expected Daily Commits
- **Hourly workflow:** ~24 commits/day
- **3.5-hour workflow:** ~7 commits/day
- **Total:** ~31 commits/day

### ⚠️ Contribution Graph Issue
**Current Issue:** Commits are NOT appearing in your contribution graph

**Why:** GitHub Actions using `GITHUB_TOKEN` don't count as personal contributions

**Solution:** Add a Personal Access Token (PAT)
- See `SETUP_CONTRIBUTIONS.md` for detailed instructions
- Once PAT_TOKEN is added, all future commits will appear in your profile
- Current commits will still use your name/email but won't count as contributions

### 🔧 Next Steps
1. Create a Personal Access Token on GitHub
2. Add it as a secret named `PAT_TOKEN` in your repository
3. Workflows will automatically use it (already configured)
4. Future commits will appear in your contribution graph

### ✅ Verification Summary
- ✅ Auto-commits working perfectly
- ✅ Running on schedule (1 hour and 3.5 hours)
- ✅ Correct email and username configured
- ✅ PAT support ready
- ⏳ Waiting for PAT_TOKEN to enable contribution tracking
